This thesis will investigate how to optimize lightweight object detection models for edge-based 
drone surveillance in challenging visual conditions. Special attention will be paid to scenarios 
involving fog, nighttime operations, and low-resolution thermal imagery. The study will 
explore how synthetic augmentation strategies and sensor-effect modelling can improve 
detection robustness while maintaining real-time inference capabilities.

# Specifically, the research will explore below questions:
• **Real-Time Edge Deployment:** How can lightweight models be optimized for edge 
devices with limited resources, ensuring real-time inference without sacrificing 
accuracy?
• **Environmental Robustness:** How can synthetic data techniques be used to simulate 
low-visibility conditions, and to what extent do these augmentations improve the 
robustness of models under real-world challenges?
• **Model Complexity vs. Performance Trade-Offs:** What is the performance trade-off 
between complex, high-accuracy models and lightweight models optimized for edge 
devices in terms of both environmental robustness and real-time processing?
