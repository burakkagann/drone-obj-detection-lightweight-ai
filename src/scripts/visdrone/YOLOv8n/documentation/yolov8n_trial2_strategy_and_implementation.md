batch: 12   # Reduced from 16 due to higher memory requirements
```
**Impact**: 30% more pixels for small object visibility and feature extraction

#### Optimized Augmentation for Small Objects
```yaml
# Enhanced multi-scale training
mosaic: 0.9        # Increased from 0.8 (more scale diversity)
copy_paste: 0.4    # Increased from 0.3 (small object augmentation)

# Reduced geometric distortion (preserve small objects)
degrees: 3.0       # Reduced from 5.0 (less rotation distortion)
translate: 0.15    # Reduced from 0.2 (stable positioning)
scale: 0.9         # Reduced from 0.8 (less scale variation)
perspective: 0.00005  # Minimal perspective distortion
```

#### Advanced Learning Configuration
```yaml
# Refined learning parameters
lr0: 0.003         # Further reduced from 0.005 (fine-grained learning)
lrf: 0.01          # Lower final ratio for better convergence
warmup_epochs: 6.0 # Extended from 5.0 (stability for small objects)
momentum: 0.95     # Increased from 0.937 (stability)
```

#### Loss Function Optimization
```yaml
# Small object detection focus
box: 8.0           # Increased from 7.5 (precise localization)
cls: 0.4           # Reduced from 0.5 (balance with box loss)
dfl: 1.3           # Reduced from 1.5 (small object focus)
```

### 2.2 Multi-Scale Training Enhancement
```yaml
multi_scale: True      # Enable scale-invariant training
close_mosaic: 15       # Extended mosaic period (vs 10 in Trial-1)
auto_augment: randaugment  # Advanced augmentation
patience: 25           # Extended early stopping
