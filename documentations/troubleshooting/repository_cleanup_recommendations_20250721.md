# Repository Cleanup Recommendations
**Date**: 2025-07-21  
**Status**: Trial-3/4 already deleted by user ‚úÖ  
**Purpose**: Optimize repository structure for 40-day thesis completion timeline

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED CLEANUP
- **Trial-3 and Trial-4 folders**: Already deleted by user
- **Documentation structure**: Created 9 new documentation categories

## üö® PRIORITY CLEANUP TARGETS

### 1. Training Runs Cleanup (`runs/train/`)

#### **DELETE - Failed/Incomplete Training Runs:**
```
runs/train/yolo5n_baseline/          # Incomplete baseline run
runs/train/yolo5n_visdrone/          # Incomplete run
runs/train/yolo5n_visdrone_cuda/     # Incomplete run (but has some results)
runs/train/yolov5n_dota/            # Only has config files, no training
runs/train/yolov5n_visdrone2/       # Only config file
runs/train/yolov5n_visdrone3/       # Only config file
runs/train/yolov5n_visdrone4/       # Only config file
runs/train/yolov5n_visdrone5/       # Only config file
runs/train/yolov5n_visdrone6/       # Only config file
runs/train/yolov5n_visdrone7/       # Only config file
runs/train/yolov5n_visdrone8/       # Only config file
runs/train/yolov5n_visdrone9/       # Only config file
runs/train/yolov5n_visdrone/        # Incomplete run with multiple events
```

#### **PRESERVE - Critical Training Results:**
```
runs/train/yolov5n_visdrone_trial2_20250718_015408/    # ‚≠ê BEST RESULT - 22.6% mAP@0.5
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ best.pt                                            # Critical model weights
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ results.csv                                       # Performance metrics
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ results.png                                       # Performance graphs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ confusion_matrix.png                             # Analysis charts

runs/train/yolov5n_visdrone_trial2_20250717_190005/  # Earlier Trial-2 attempt
runs/train/yolov5n_visdrone_trial3a_20250720_003218/ # Complete Trial-3A results (for comparison)
```

### 2. Virtual Environment Consolidation

#### **Current Virtual Environments Assessment:**
```
venvs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ augment_venv/                    # ‚úÖ KEEP - Augmentation pipeline
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dota/venvs/                     # ‚ùì ASSESS - Multiple DOTA environments
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mobilenet_ssd_env/              # ‚úÖ KEEP - MobileNet-SSD training
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nanodet_env/                    # ‚úÖ KEEP - NanoDet training
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tensorflow_env/                 # ‚ùì CONSOLIDATE - May overlap with mobilenet_ssd_env
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ visdrone/yolov5n_visdrone_env/  # ‚úÖ KEEP - Primary YOLOv5n environment
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ yolov5n_env/                    # ‚ùì CONSOLIDATE - May overlap with visdrone env
```

#### **Consolidation Recommendations:**
1. **Keep Core Environments**: `augment_venv`, `mobilenet_ssd_env`, `nanodet_env`, `yolov5n_visdrone_env`
2. **Assess Overlaps**: Check if `tensorflow_env` and `yolov5n_env` can be merged
3. **DOTA Environments**: Consolidate DOTA-specific environments into single `dota_env`

### 3. Configuration Files Organization

#### **Current Config Status:**
- Trial-2 configs are properly organized ‚úÖ
- Multiple unused YAML configs exist in various trial folders

#### **Cleanup Actions:**
1. **Extract Trial-2 configs** to main config directory before deleting runs
2. **Remove redundant configs** from deleted training runs
3. **Organize by priority**: Trial-2 > Working configs > Archive unused

### 4. Log Files Management

#### **Keep Essential Logs:**
```
logs/visdrone/yolov5n/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ training_20250704_174806.log    # ‚úÖ KEEP - Important training session
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ training_20250704_174849.log    # ‚úÖ KEEP - Important training session
```

#### **Cleanup Recommendations:**
- Archive old log files that don't correspond to important results
- Keep logs that align with preserved training runs

## üìã CLEANUP EXECUTION PLAN

### **Phase 1: Backup Critical Data (PRIORITY)**
1. **Copy Trial-2 results** to `documentations/optimization-results/`
2. **Extract hyperparameter configs** from Trial-2 best run
3. **Backup model weights** from Trial-2 best run

### **Phase 2: Execute Deletions**
```powershell
# Delete failed/incomplete training runs
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "runs\train\yolo5n_baseline"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "runs\train\yolo5n_visdrone"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "runs\train\yolov5n_dota"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "runs\train\yolov5n_visdrone2"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "runs\train\yolov5n_visdrone3"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "runs\train\yolov5n_visdrone4"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "runs\train\yolov5n_visdrone5"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "runs\train\yolov5n_visdrone6"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "runs\train\yolov5n_visdrone7"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "runs\train\yolov5n_visdrone8"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "runs\train\yolov5n_visdrone9"
```

### **Phase 3: Organize Remaining Structure**
1. **Rename Trial-2 folders** for clarity
2. **Update documentation** with new structure
3. **Create cleanup summary report**

## üîÑ POST-CLEANUP STRUCTURE

### **Streamlined Training Runs:**
```
runs/train/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ yolov5n_visdrone_trial2_BEST/     # Renamed from trial2_20250718_015408
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ yolov5n_visdrone_trial2_ALT/      # Renamed from trial2_20250717_190005  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ yolov5n_visdrone_trial3a_REF/     # Kept for comparison reference
```

### **Documentation Updates:**
- Document all deleted runs with reasons
- Create performance comparison summary
- Update CLAUDE.md with new structure

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISKS AND PRECAUTIONS

### **Before Deleting:**
1. **Verify no critical data** in folders marked for deletion
2. **Backup any custom configurations** that might be lost
3. **Check for hardcoded paths** in scripts that might break

### **Critical Preservation:**
- **Never delete**: `runs/train/yolov5n_visdrone_trial2_20250718_015408/`
- **Model weights**: `best.pt`, `last.pt` from successful runs
- **Results**: `results.csv`, performance graphs, confusion matrices

## üìä EXPECTED BENEFITS

1. **Reduced Repository Size**: ~60% reduction in training artifacts
2. **Improved Navigation**: Clear focus on successful experiments
3. **Faster Development**: Less confusion about which configs to use
4. **Better Documentation**: Organized structure supports thesis writing

## üéØ NEXT STEPS AFTER CLEANUP

1. **Trial-2 Optimization**: Focus on improving 22.6% mAP baseline
2. **Multi-Model Comparison**: Clear path for MobileNet-SSD and NanoDet training
3. **Edge Device Testing**: Streamlined environment for deployment testing

---
**Cleanup Status**: Ready for execution pending user approval  
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes for full cleanup  
**Risk Level**: Low (critical data identified and preserved)
