# YOLOv5n VisDrone Setup and Training Log

## Overview
This document tracks the setup process and progression of training YOLOv5n on the VisDrone dataset. It includes environment setup, configuration changes, and troubleshooting steps taken to optimize the training process for memory constraints.

## Environment Setup

### CUDA Configuration
- **CUDA Version**: 12.9
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 3060 Laptop GPU (6GB VRAM)
- **PyTorch**: Installed with CUDA 12.1 support (compatible with CUDA 12.9)
- **Verification**:
  - CUDA installation verified via `nvcc --version`
  - GPU detection confirmed via `nvidia-smi`
  - PyTorch CUDA availability verified

### Virtual Environment
- Created dedicated virtual environment for YOLOv5n training
- Installed required dependencies with CUDA support
- Environment location: `venvs/visdrone/yolov5n_visdrone_env/`

## Configuration File Organization

### Initial Issues
- Configuration files were initially placed in incorrect directory
- Memory issues encountered during YOLOv5n training on VisDrone dataset

### Reorganization
1. Moved configuration files to correct location: `config/visdrone/yolov5n_v1/`
2. Created/Updated key configuration files:
   - `visdrone_yolov5n.yaml`: Dataset configuration with correct paths
   - `model_yolov5n.yaml`: Model configuration optimized for VisDrone

### Configuration Optimizations
- Adjusted hyperparameters for memory efficiency
- Modified batch size and image size for GPU memory constraints
- Updated data paths to reflect correct dataset location

## Training Script Modifications

### CUDA Detection Issues
1. Initial Problem: Script using CPU despite CUDA availability
2. Solutions Implemented:
   - Modified PowerShell script for proper CUDA detection
   - Changed device specification from "auto" to "0"
   - Fixed hyperparameter loading sequence

### Script Improvements
- Modified hyperparameter loading to occur after YAML configuration loading
- Implemented memory optimization techniques
- Added proper error handling and logging

## Current Status

### Working Components
- ✅ CUDA and GPU properly detected
- ✅ Configuration files in correct locations
- ✅ Training script modified for CUDA usage
- ✅ Hyperparameter loading issues resolved

### Next Steps
1. Monitor initial training run
2. Track memory usage during training
3. Adjust batch size if needed
4. Implement checkpointing for training recovery

## Memory Management Strategy

### Implemented Solutions
1. Optimized batch size for available VRAM
2. Modified image processing pipeline
3. Implemented gradient accumulation
4. Adjusted model complexity while maintaining accuracy

### Monitoring Points
- GPU memory usage
- Training speed
- Model convergence
- System stability

## Troubleshooting Log

### Issue 1: Memory Constraints
- **Problem**: Initial training attempts exceeded GPU memory
- **Solution**: Implemented batch size and image size adjustments

### Issue 2: CUDA Detection
- **Problem**: Training defaulting to CPU
- **Solution**: Modified device specification and CUDA detection logic

### Issue 3: Hyperparameter Loading
- **Problem**: TypeError during hyperparameter loading
- **Solution**: Reordered configuration loading sequence
