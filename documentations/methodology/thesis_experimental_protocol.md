**Student**: Burak KaÄŸan YÄ±lmazer  
**Protocol Version**: 2.0 - True Baseline Framework

## Executive Summary

This document establishes the comprehensive experimental protocol for demonstrating environmental robustness in lightweight object detection models for drone surveillance applications.

## Research Objectives

### Primary Research Question
**How can lightweight AI models maintain robust object detection performance in low-visibility drone surveillance environments?**

### Specific Hypotheses
1. **H1**: Environmental augmentation improves model robustness in adverse conditions
2. **H2**: Combined real-time + pre-processed augmentation outperforms real-time only
3. **H3**: Performance gains are maintained across different environmental severities
4. **H4**: Robustness improvements are consistent across object classes

## Experimental Design

### **Two-Phase Comparative Study**

#### **Phase 1: True Baseline Performance (Control Group)**
- **Dataset**: Original dataset only (clean, unmodified)
- **Augmentation**: None (minimal preprocessing: resize, normalize only)
- **Purpose**: Establish absolute model performance reference point
- **Models**: All target architectures (YOLOv5n, YOLOv8n, MobileNet-SSD, NanoDet)
- **Rationale**: Pure model capability measurement for maximum effect size demonstration

#### **Phase 2: Environmental Robustness (Treatment Group)**  
- **Dataset**: Environmental augmented dataset (original + synthetic environmental conditions)
- **Augmentation**: Standard real-time + environmental pre-processing
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate complete methodology impact vs. true baseline
- **Models**: Same architectures as Phase 1
- **Rationale**: Show total research contribution and robustness improvement

### **Controlled Variables**
- âœ… **Model architectures** (identical across phases)
- âœ… **Training hyperparameters** (standardized configurations)
- âœ… **Hardware setup** (consistent GPU/CPU usage)
- âœ… **Evaluation metrics** (mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5:0.95, FPS, model size)
- âœ… **Test set composition** (fair comparison protocols)

### **Independent Variables**
- ðŸŽ¯ **Training methodology** (true baseline vs. complete environmental robustness)
- ðŸŽ¯ **Environmental conditions** (original, fog, night, motion blur, rain, snow)
- ðŸŽ¯ **Condition severity** (light, medium, heavy)
- ðŸŽ¯ **Model architecture** (YOLOv5n, YOLOv8n, MobileNet-SSD, NanoDet)

### **Dependent Variables**
- ðŸ“Š **Detection accuracy** (mAP@0.5, precision, recall)
- ðŸ“Š **Inference speed** (FPS, latency)
- ðŸ“Š **Model efficiency** (parameters, FLOPS, memory usage)
- ðŸ“Š **Robustness metrics** (performance degradation under adverse conditions)

### **Environmental Augmentation Pipeline**

#### **Fog Simulation**
```python
# Physics-based atmospheric scattering model
I_fog(x) = I_clear(x) * t(x) + A * (1 - t(x))
# Where t(x) = exp(-Î² * d(x)) # transmission map
# Î² = scattering coefficient, d(x) = depth map
```

#### **Night Simulation**  
```python
# Gamma correction with noise injection
I_night = Î³ * (I_original / 255)^gamma * 255
# gamma âˆˆ [0.3, 0.7] # darkness levels
# Add Gaussian noise: Ïƒ âˆˆ [5, 15] # sensor noise
```

#### **Motion Blur Simulation**
```python
# Linear motion kernel convolution
K = motion_kernel(length, angle)
I_blur = cv2.filter2D(I_original, -1, K)
# length âˆˆ [5, 25] pixels # blur intensity
```

#### **Rain/Snow Simulation**
```python
# Precipitation overlay with atmospheric effects
I_rain = I_original + rain_overlay(intensity, density, direction)
# intensity âˆˆ [0.1, 0.5] # visibility reduction
```
